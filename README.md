## Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

### Project Overview

This project focuses on applying K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to segment customers from an online retail dataset. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value), enabling targeted marketing strategies and improved customer relationship management.

The analysis covers the entire data science pipeline: data acquisition, rigorous data cleaning, advanced feature engineering using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model, robust outlier detection and handling, data scaling, K-Means clustering, and in-depth interpretation of the resulting customer segments.

### Dataset

The dataset used is the **Online Retail II Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains transactional data from a UK-based online retail store.

### Stack & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations (underlying Pandas).
- **Scikit-learn:** For K-Means clustering and data scaling (`StandardScaler`).
- **Matplotlib:** For static data visualizations (histograms, scatter plots).
- **Seaborn:** For enhanced statistical data visualizations (box plots, violin plots, bar plots).
